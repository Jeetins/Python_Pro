### Introduction to Data Analytics

Data analytics is the process of examining data to extract insights and improve business performance The process involves several key steps:

1.  **Business Problem Understanding**: Define the client's needs and project expectations
2.  **Data Collection and Exploration**: Gather data, often using tools like SQL, and understand its content
3.  **Data Cleaning**: Remove incorrect data, duplicates, missing values, and outliers using tools like Power Query, Pandas, or SQL
4.  **Data Analysis**: Apply various questions and observations to the data, often utilizing Python libraries like Seaborn
5.  **Presentation**: Present the findings, typically through dashboards created with tools like Power BI

The document also outlines different types of analytics, including:

  * **Descriptive Analytics**: Describes past data to understand what happened
  * **Diagnostic Analytics**: Explains why something happened
  * **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasts future outcomes or problems
  * **Prescriptive Analytics**: Recommends actions to take

### Python Fundamentals

#### Advantages of Python

Python is a popular choice for data analysis and programming due to its key advantages:

  * **Open Source**: It is free to use and does not require a license
  * **Simple Syntax**: The syntax is similar to the English language, making it easy to read It doesn't rely on curly brackets or semicolons and variables do not require explicit data type assignment (dynamic typing)

#### How to Run Python

Python code can be executed in various environments:

  * Standard Python Installation (e.g., Python App, IDLE) 
  * Online Compilers (e.g., Google Colab) 
  * Anaconda (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Spyder) 
  * Other IDEs (e.g., VS Code) 

#### Core Python Concepts

##### Errors and Execution

The document identifies several types of errors:

  * **Syntax Error**
  * **Run-Time Error** 
  * **Logical Error** 

Python uses both a compiler and an interpreter. A **compiler** runs code at a program level, while an **interpreter** runs code line by line

##### Comments

Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the interpreter.

  * **Single-line comments**: Begin with the `#` symbol
  * **Multi-line comments**: Enclosed within three single quotes (`'''`) or three double quotes (`"""`)

##### Values and Variables

A **variable** is a location in memory used to store a value

  * **Dynamic Typing**: You don't need to declare a variable's data type (like `int`, `float`, `string`) as Python assigns it automatically when a value is assigned
  * **Mutability**: The value of a variable can be changed during program execution
  * **Assignment**: In Python, the right side of the `=` symbol is executed first, and then the value is assigned to the variable on the left

##### Naming Rules

Rules for naming variables, functions, and other elements:

1.  Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (`_`).
2.  Can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.
3.  Cannot start with a number.
4.  Names are case-sensitive (e.g., `age`, `Age`, and `AGE` are different variables).
5.  Cannot be a reserved keyword.

##### Functions

A **function** is a reusable group of statements that performs a specific task Functions can take input and produce output, helping to avoid code repetition and making programs easier to manage

  * **In-built Functions**: Functions that are part of Python's standard library, such as `print()`, `max()`, and `len()`
  * **User-Defined Functions**: Functions created by the user with the `def` keyword

### Data Types and Structures

#### Fundamental Data Types

Fundamental data types store a single value and are immutable

  * **Integer (`int`)**: Whole numbers (e.g., `123`)
  * **Float (`float`)**: Numbers with a decimal point (e.g., `24.5`)
  * **Complex (`complex`)**: Numbers with a real and imaginary part (e.g., `2+3j`)
  * **Boolean (`bool`)**: `True` or `False`. `False` is only assigned to a value of zero; all other values are `True`
  * **String (`str`)**: Any value enclosed in single or double quotes (e.g., `"Hello"`)

#### Advanced Data Types (Containers)

These data types store multiple values and are often referred to as collections.

  * **List (`list`)**: An ordered, mutable collection of items enclosed in square brackets `[]` Items do not have to be of the same data type and can be duplicated
  * **Tuple (`tuple`)**: An ordered, immutable collection of items enclosed in parentheses `()` It is similar to a list, but its elements cannot be changed once assigned
  * **Dictionary (`dict`)**: A mutable collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}` Keys must be unique and immutable, while values can be of any data type
  * **Set (`set`)**: An unordered, mutable collection of unique items enclosed in curly braces `{}` Sets do not support indexing or slicing

-----

### Operators

Operators are special symbols or words used to perform operations on values and variables

  * **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for mathematical operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)
  * **Assignment Operators**: Used to assign values to variables (e.g., `=`, `+=`, `-=`)
  * **Comparison Operators**: Used to compare values and return `True` or `False` (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`)
  * **Logical Operators**: Used to check multiple conditions (`and`, `or`, `not`)
  * **Identity Operators**: Check if two variables refer to the same object (`is`, `is not`)
  * **Membership Operators**: Test if a value is found in a sequence (`in`, `not in`)

-----

### Control Flow

#### Conditional Statements

These statements control the execution flow of the code based on conditions

  * **`if` statement**: Executes a block of code only if the condition is `True`
  * **`if-else` statement**: Executes a block of code if the `if` condition is `True` and an alternative block if it is `False`
  * **`if-elif` statement**: Allows for checking multiple conditions sequentially
  * **`if-elif-else` statement**: Combines the above to handle multiple conditions and a final catch-all case

#### Loops

Loops are used for the repetition of code blocks

  * **`while` loop**: Repeats a block of code as long as a condition remains `True`
  * **`for` loop**: Iterates through each item in a sequence (e.g., string, list, tuple, dictionary)
  * **`break`**: Terminates the loop execution
  * **`continue`**: Skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next one
  * **`pass`**: A null statement that does nothing
